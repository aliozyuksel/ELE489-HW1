# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch. The project evaluates different distance metrics, including Euclidean, Manhattan, and Mahalanobis, using the Wine dataset.

## Files

- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that contains data analysis, KNN implementation, and evaluation.
- `knn.py`: Python script implementing the KNN algorithm.
- `wine.data`: Dataset used for training and testing.

## Requirements

To run this project, install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy IPython scikit-learn
